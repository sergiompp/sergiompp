### Hi, I'm Sergio 👋👨‍💻

Currently, I'm studying mobile and space communications engineering at the [University Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Inicio) (Spain)📡🛰 although I am also an electronic technician 🔌.

Also, I am working in [Getronics](https://www.getronics.com/es/) as help desker and systems technician 💻 for the university but I like to program, either in my professional life or on my own in different personal projects like app for Android, Arduino or use a Raspberry.

My main interests are energy, finances, robotics, electronics, home automation and programming and I believe very strongly that everything can be connected to each other in order to make a better world where we can live.
 

## How do I like program?

My main programming languages/platforms are:
- Java
- C
- Python
