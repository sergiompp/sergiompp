# Hi! I'm Sergio 👋👨‍💻

Currently, I'm studying mobile and space communications engineering at the [University Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Inicio) (Spain)📡🛰 although I am also an electronic technician 🔌.

I'm working in [Akkodis](https://www.akkodis.com) as a telecommunication engineer 📡💻 but I like to code either in my professional life or on my own in different personal projects like android app, Arduino or use a Raspberry.

My main interests are energy, finances, robotics, electronics, home automation and programming and I believe very strongly that everything of these themes can be connected to each other in order to make a better world where we can live.
 

## 💻 How do I like program?

My main programming languages/platforms are:
- Java
- C
- Python

And... What other programming languages do I want to learn? Well:
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Swift
- [ ] C ++
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] \(Feel free to suggest me)
